# Main Functionality

This project implements a modular architecture for the acquisition, storage, and exploitation of weather and geographic data. Over the course of three sprints, four Java modules have been developed that work together through a messaging system based on Apache ActiveMQ.

In Sprint 1, two feeders were built to retrieve up-to-date information from external APIs and store it locally. In Sprint 2, real-time event exchange was introduced, allowing data to be published and stored in a structured manner in files organized by date and source. Finally, in Sprint 3, a business unit was developed to consume these data both in real time and from historical records, providing the end user with query, analysis, and recommendation functionalities through a command-line interface.

The system automates the entire data lifecycle and demonstrates how to design scalable solutions aimed at decision-making in real-world scenarios.

# Resources Used

# Project Architecture

The project is organized into four independent modules that reflect the development phases of each sprint, following a modular architecture and the Publisher/Subscriber pattern with a clear separation of responsibilities. The APIs used were selected based on their accessibility and quality: the GeoDB Cities API offers global coverage and advanced filtering by country and population, while OpenWeatherMap provides detailed and up-to-date weather forecasts in real time. Additionally, a hybrid datamart structure was designed to enable both real-time processing and deferred analysis, combining the use of SQLite for local persistence during ingestion and an event store organized chronologically and hierarchically by topic and source.

## System Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the overall system architecture: the `feeder` modules act as producers, sending events through the ActiveMQ broker. The `event-store-builder` consumes and stores them, while the `business-unit` accesses data both in real time and from the datamart for further analysis.

### `event-store-builder`

**Main Function:**  
Consumes real-time events from ActiveMQ and stores them in structured files organized by topic, source, and date.

**Package and Classes:**

- **control**
   - `EventProcessor`: Processes, deserializes, and organizes received messages.
   - `EventStoreBuilder`: Main class responsible for initialization and subscription management.
   - `EventSubscriber`: Listens to relevant events on ActiveMQ.
   - `EventWriter`: Writes events to the filesystem under the structure:  
     `eventstore/{topic}/{ss}/{YYYYMMDD}.events`

---

### `business-unit`

**Main Function:**  
Accesses both historical and real-time event data to perform analysis, queries, and recommendations through a console-based interface.

**Packages and Classes:**

- **control**
   - `Main`: Entry point for the business unit; orchestrates different types of user queries.

- **model**

**Note:** Each module runs as a continuous service. Use separate terminals so that all modules can run simultaneously.

### SOLID Principles

This application follows SOLID principles to ensure modularity, flexibility, and maintainability across all modules.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  *Example:* The `DestinationPublisher` class (`destination-feeder`) is solely responsible for converting destination data into JSON messages and sending them to the ActiveMQ broker. It does not manage filtering or data persistence.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
  *Example:* The `WeatherProvider` interface (`weather-feeder`) allows new providers to be added without modifying the logic in `WeatherCoordinator`, making the module easily extensible.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
  *Example:* The `SqliteDestinationStore` class (`destination-feeder`) can replace any implementation of the `DestinationStore` interface without affecting the behavior of `DestinationCoordinator`.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
  *Example:* The `EventProcessor` interface (`event-store-builder`) contains only the methods necessary for processing events, avoiding forcing implementers to depend on unused functionality.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  *Example:* In the `event-store-builder` module, the `EventProcessor` and `EventWriter` abstractions are injected into the business logic instead of using concrete classes, promoting loose coupling and testability.
